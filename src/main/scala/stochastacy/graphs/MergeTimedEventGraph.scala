/**
 * Merges two timed event sources into a single source that conforms to the timed event source
 * restrictions.
 *
 * Restrictions on the input sources:
 * * each source must begin with equal `Tick` elements
 * * each subsequent `Tick` element in each source must have a clock value exactly `clockIncrementMs`
 * greater than the last `Tick` element in the same stream
 * * this ensures `Tick` elements from both sources can be aligned pairwise
 *
 * Guarantees on the output source:
 * * the output source will be a valid timed event source
 * * it will have a single `Tick` for each `Tick` element in the input sources
 * * the interleaved timed event elements from each source will be interleaved in the
 * output source, in no particular order
 * * relative order of elements originating in each source will be preserved in the
 * output source, but elements from each source will be interleaved randomly
